# match/ — Sawblade matching engine (Python)

Phase 1.5 part A: TONE3000 access (`sawblade_match.t3k`) and the `sawblade-t3k` CLI.
Spec: `docs/specs/phase1_5.md`.

## Setup

```
python3 -m venv match/.venv
match/.venv/bin/pip install -e 'match[dev]'
match/.venv/bin/pytest match          # no network needed
```

### Get the publishable key

1. Sign in at tone3000.com and open **Settings -> API keys**.
2. Copy the **publishable key** (`t3k_pub_...`). It is the OAuth `client_id` and is safe to keep in
   an env var or container secret.
3. Never use the secret key (`t3k_cs_...`); the CLI refuses it.

```
export TONE3000_CLIENT_ID=t3k_pub_xxxxxxxx
```

### Log in (device flow, works headless)

```
sawblade-t3k login
```

It prints a code and `https://www.tone3000.com/activate`. Open that on any device, sign in, enter
the code. Tokens are saved to `~/.config/sawblade/t3k_tokens.json` (mode 0600, override with
`SAWBLADE_T3K_TOKEN_FILE`) and refreshed automatically (rotation is persisted).

Containers are ephemeral: `login` prints the refresh token **once**. Save it as the
`TONE3000_REFRESH_TOKEN` secret and a fresh container logs in without the device step (stored tokens,
when present, win over the env seed). Access tokens and Authorization headers are never printed or logged.

## Usage

```
sawblade-t3k whoami
sawblade-t3k pull [--favorites] [--gear amp pedal ir] [--no-trending] [--no-latest]
                  [--no-download] [--max-models-per-tone 3] [--manifest pool.json] [--cache-dir DIR]
                  [--max-age-months 18] [--min-favorites 100] [--min-downloads 1000]
                  [--popularity-percentile P] [--keep-favorites-below-floor]
                  [--no-a1-fallback] [--favorites-bypass-recency]
sawblade-t3k resolve presets/chainsaw_body.json [--first-model]   # -> presets/chainsaw_body.resolved.json
```

* `pull` builds the candidate pool from **favorited** (always fetched) + **trending** + **latest** and
  applies the quality filter: A2 preferred (A1 only if no A2 models), <= 18 months old (favorites too),
  and absolute popularity floors (>= 100 favorites and >= 1000 downloads). `--popularity-percentile P`
  additionally requires the per-gear Pth percentile (off by default). Favorited tones below the floors are
  excluded with a reason unless `--keep-favorites-below-floor` (then kept and flagged). `amp-cab` rigs are
  references only. The manifest `<cache>/pool_manifest.json` records every decision and reason and lists
  **all** models of each included tone (id, name, architecture_version) as separate candidates: models within
  a tone are usually different settings (gain, channel, boost), so choosing one is a tone decision left to the
  matcher. When downloading, at most `--max-models-per-tone N` (default 3, API order) models per tone are
  fetched, so a 168-IR pack is not bulk-downloaded; `--no-download` fetches none.
* `resolve` finds every capture whose `source.provider == "tone3000"` (needs `source.id`, optional
  `source.modelId`), fetches it (cache hit = no network), and sets `file` (absolute cache path),
  `sha256`, `source.modelId`, `url`, `title`, `creator`, `license`. With no `modelId`: if the tone has exactly one
  model it is used; otherwise `resolve` fails (exit 1) listing the model ids and names, unless `--first-model`
  is given. Output goes to `<name>.resolved.json` next to the input (or `-o`); the input is never modified.
  Resolved presets contain machine-specific absolute paths and are git-ignored (`*.resolved.json`).
* Cache: `~/.cache/sawblade/captures/<tone_id>/<model_id>.<nam|wav>` + `meta.json` (override with
  `SAWBLADE_CACHE_DIR`). Files are sha256-verified on every hit.

### `--search` (opt-in, commercial)

`pull --search "query"` adds `tones/search` results to the pool. That endpoint is outside TONE3000's
free tier: **a commercial agreement with TONE3000 is required before shipping anything that uses it**
(Sawblade is commercial). It is off by default and uses a separate, tighter client-side rate bucket.

### Rate limits and logging

100 requests/min client-side token bucket; 429 and 502/503/504 are retried with exponential backoff
(honouring `Retry-After`); a 401 triggers one refresh + retry. The `X-Tone3000-Deprecations` response header is
logged at WARNING. Use `-v` for INFO logs.
